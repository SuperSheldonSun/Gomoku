# Gomoku
This is a game of backgammon (five-in-a-row (game similar tic-tac-toe)) with Ai running through the processing software.

Introduction:
Gomoku is a two-player strategy board game originating from China, also known as "Lianzhu", "Gomoku Narabe", or "Five in a Row". The objective of the game is to be the first to form an unbroken line of five pieces on the board. The game is typically played on a board marked with a 19Ã—19 grid of lines, but it can also be played on smaller or larger boards.

I've updated the basic items of the game to offer two options one is to play with yourself and one is to play against each other (computer) with an opponent.
